<p>After launching in 2016, Bruin Shelter is expanding to accommodate the
increasing number of students seeking its services.</p>
<p><a href="http://dailybruin.com/2016/10/27/student-run-shelter-opens-doors-to-homeless-students/">Bruin Shelter</a>,
the first completely student-run homeless shelter in the nation exclusively for
students, provides housing to students from UCLA and other local universities.
The shelter is meant to be a temporary residence on a path to permanent housing
for residents, said co-President Kate Lieb, a fifth-year psychology student.</p>
<p>Based on Harvard University’s shelter model, Bruin Shelter is a
501(c)3-designated nonprofit organization. UCLA students coordinate the program
with the founder of Bruin Shelter,
<a href="http://dailybruin.com/2016/01/07/students-start-bruin-shelter-for-westwood-homeless-population/">Louis Tse</a>.
Tse received his doctoral degree in mechanical engineering from UCLA in 2016 and
chose to be “rationally homeless” as a student, living out of his car to
dedicate personal funds to starting the shelter.</p>
<p>Volunteers stay at Bruin Shelter from 7 to 11 p.m. each night and supervisors
spend the entire night at the shelter. Two volunteers and two supervisors
alternate between staying awake from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m. and 2 a.m. to 7 a.m. They
receive training based on the Hill’s resident assistant training, Lieb said.</p>
<p>Last year, the shelter housed about 10 students at a time, and plans to
accommodate more in the future. Bruin Shelter received more than 100
applications after its pilot year and will prioritize students in need of
immediate housing support. However, it has been unable to house residents during
construction this quarter.</p>
<p>Volunteers offer resources such as financial and mental health counseling and
connections to the Economic Crisis Response Team, which operates under Student
Affairs at UCLA and provides different forms of emergency financial aid to
students in need.</p>
<p>Lieb added that Bruin Shelter partners with graduate students in UCLA’s
department of social welfare, who act as case managers for each Bruin Shelter
resident, in addition to Swipe Out Hunger and other organizations that donate
food and other goods.</p>
