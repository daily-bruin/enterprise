The Economic Crisis Response Team, launched in 2008 as a subset of the Student
Affairs office, assists students in immediate and dire financial crisis. There
are four forms of aid students can receive through ECRT: meal vouchers,
emergency housing, one-time grants or emergency short-term loans.

Students who qualify for the meal voucher program can receive up to 11 vouchers
per quarter, which are donated by student organization Swipe Out Hunger, for a
maximum of three quarters. The Dean of Students, Maria Blandizzi, said ECRT will
explore giving students in financial crisis ongoing meal plans instead of
single-use meal vouchers.

The Student Fee Advisory Committee funds emergency housing for up to 20 days in
an open bed space in a university-owned property.

The Chancellorâ€™s Grant is a one-time grant option for up to $4,000, Blandizzi
said. UCLA provides short-term loans ranging from $1,500 to $1,700 at no
interest, which must be repaid within one to three months.

Blandizzi said ECRT incorporated a Financial Wellness Program in 2012, which
trains 10 students to help students in crisis plan and manage their finances.
