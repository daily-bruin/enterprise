      <p>A study early this year found that 42 percent of University of California
students are food-insecure. Food insecurity is defined as limited access to
adequate food because of financial constraints.</p>
<p>In response, two graduate student researchers in the Fielding School of Public
Health facilitated a qualitative study which investigated food literacy and
insecurity at UCLA.</p>
<p>Hannah Malan, a research assistant in the UC Healthy Campus Initiative, and
Tyler Watson, a doctoral student in the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health,
organized the study in 2016. They conducted 11 focus groups with undergraduate
and graduate UCLA students to investigate what factors contribute to food
insecurity at UCLA.</p>
<p>Malan and Watson are both members of the UC Global Food Initiative, which
develops solutions to food insecurity and health issues throughout the country.</p>
<p>Malan said one finding from the study that surprised her most was that students
often normalize unhealthy lifestyle choices.</p>
<p>“I was most surprised (by) how many students talked about food as a stressor in
their lives,” Malan said. “Students’ struggling with food ... replicates the
broader cultural norm that we just don’t have time or resources to take care of
ourselves when we’re living in these demanding, stressful environments.”</p>
<p>Malan and Watson’s research showed many undergraduates are unaware that
struggling with hunger meant they were food-insecure, and that the university
did not actively inform students about food literacy.</p>
<p>Malan said they also found students sometimes forgo meals to offset the costs of
university attendance.</p>
<p>“I think (what) we can do more as an institution of higher education (is) to
give students the tools they need and communicate the values of … community
health and well-being, which I think start with food,” Malan said.</p>
